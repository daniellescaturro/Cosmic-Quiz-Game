# Cosmic Quiz Game
The game is a multiple choice trivia game with an outer space theme. The questions were sources from Open Source Trivia Questions (citation: https://github.com/uberspot/OpenTriviaQA). The game was built as my first project in General Assembly's software engineering immersive.

### User Story
 * To play the game, the user accesses it from their browser at the above link, which will open on a welcome screen.
 * On the welcome screen will be an invitation to play through "Yes" and "No" buttons.
 * Once the user clicks "Yes" a start game screen appears. The user clicks the "Start Game" button and the game commences.
 * The user will have 60 seconds to answer 10 questions.
 * After clicking "Start Game", a timer loads and the first question and answer choices appear.
 * The player will click a radio button to select an answer.
 * Correct answers get marked with a green checkmark.
 * Incorrect answers get marked with a red "x" and the correct answer gets ticked with a green check mark. 
 * To win, a player must get more than half the questions correct within the 60 second time limit. 
 * At the conclusion of the game, the score is displayed and regardless of winning or losing, the user is invited to play   again through a "Play Again" button.

### Technical Specifications
The game was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, primarily jQuery. It operates through the browser with no installation required.

### Challenges & Potential Forthcoming Features
 * After starting the game, the first thing that happens is the first question loads. Very quickly thereafter, the timer loads at the top of the page and moves the question content down the page. This leaves an impression of the content "jumping" and should be fixed. 
 * Add functionality to make it a one- or two-player game. 
 * I would also like to improve the format, styling and improve the responsive design.
