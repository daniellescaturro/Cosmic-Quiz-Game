Project Proposal for Quiz Game (working title)

Concept:  a one-player quiz game

High-level Outline:
	- Welcome screen asking if the user wants to play. Buttons for Yes and No. 
	- Player will answer a set of 10 multiple choice questions
	- Each question will have 4 options for the answer
	- Player makes a selction, selection is highlighted in some way (e.g., a box around the selection)
	- Answer is evaluated for correctness
		-- Response is provided to player via an animation 
			--- Correct response gets a green checkmark
			--- Incorrect answer gets a red X and the correct answer gets a green checkmark
	- Player earns 1 point for each correct answer. No points are lost for missed questions. 
	- Process repeats through 10 questions
	- Correct responses/ points are tracked throughout the game
	- At the end, the total points are provided to the player.
		-- A win entails, answering more than half the question correct, so 6 or more.
		-- On the final screen, a button is included asking if the player wants to play again. This restarts the game.   

Stretch Goal:
	- Include a timer for answering each question, i.e, the player has 10 seconds to answer the question or it is marked incorrect
