PROJECT PROPOSAL - QUIZ GAME (working title)

Concept:  a one-player quiz game

High-level Outline:
	- Welcome screen asking if the user wants to play. Buttons for Yes and No. 
	- Player will answer a set of 10 multiple choice questions
	- Each question will have 4 options for the answer
	- Player makes a selction, selection is highlighted in some way (e.g., a box around the selection)
	- Answer is evaluated for correctness
		-- Response is provided to player via an animation 
			--- Correct response gets a green checkmark
			--- Incorrect answer gets a red X and the correct answer gets a green checkmark
	- Player earns 1 point for each correct answer. No points are lost for missed questions. 
	- Process repeats through 10 questions
	- Correct responses/ points are tracked throughout the game
	- At the end, the total points are provided to the player.
		-- A win entails, answering more than half the question correct, so 6 or more.
		-- On the final screen, a button is included asking if the player wants to play again. This restarts the game. 

//DO I WANT A THEME FOR QUESTIONS? FOCUS ON SOMETHING I KNOW.  

Stretch Goal:
	- Include a timer for answering each question, i.e, the player has 10 seconds to answer the question or it is marked incorrect
	- Add a second player.
	- Include a tracker for correct responses the player can see as he/she plays
	- Curate triva questions. Decide whether to expand to broader space theme, or stick to planets. Organize questions into into easy, intermediate and hard questions for first, second and third sections of game. 

Nice to haves (added after initial proposal):
	- Fonts
	- Styling/fonts for question pages


PROJECT PLAN / ACTION STEPS

	x- Identify several trivia questions (~3) I can use for early phases of design and testing
	x- Create homepage with invitation to play and yes/no buttons, with functionality for playing or exiting
		x-- Use event listner ('onclick') to say "goodbye" for "no" and clear the screen for "yes"
	x- Create first question page where trivia question is chosen at random, with functionality for player to click on a response
		x-- If yes, clear homepage 
		x-- Create div for question and child divs for choices
		x--create an array of objects of questions and choices
	x - Use radio buttons for player selection
	x - Compare input to correct answer
		x -- If player selected answer matches "correctAnswer", else "incorrect"
	x - Create animation for correct answer - green check mark by answer
	x - Create animation for incorrect answer - red x by incorrect selection and green checkmark by correct answer, keeping player selection in radio button
	x - Create tracking of correct answers
	x - Initiate moving to next question
	x - Repeats until completes 3 questions	
	x - Create assessment page, if player got more than half correct = win, if player got less than half questions right = lose, show counter on screen, invite to play again with yes/no button
	x - Add bank of trivia questions (~80). 
	x - Decide on theme for questions (space). 
	x - Randomize question selection, removing questions already used
	x - Begin testing with 5 questions
	  - Separate functions into smaller chuncks (game is currently essentially one big function)
	  - Style pages
	  - Keep adding questions from questionBank to questions array (currently at 21, needs to get to 80)
	  - Stretch: Add a time/counter for each page to count down while player answers questions.


QUESTIONS:
	- Why isn't much of my CSS working?
		-- Buttons on different pages behaving differently despite divs, classes and id's (none of buttons centering, yes/no button not taking background color, font color, font size, etc.)
		-- Background image not working. (Had it on there through html as small image in the body. Couldn't get it to cover whole page (tried putting it in html, style.css/body, etc. Now not working at all, got an red " on the following div (welcomeScreen), but all the syntax looked correct).
	- How do I link app.js files together so they work together? Currently my questions array takes up a lot of room and would be nice to put this in another file.
