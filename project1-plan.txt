PROJECT PROPOSAL - QUIZ GAME (working title)

Concept:  a one-player quiz game

High-level Outline:
	- Welcome screen asking if the user wants to play. Buttons for Yes and No. 
	- Player will answer a set of 10 multiple choice questions
	- Each question will have 4 options for the answer
	- Player makes a selction, selection is highlighted in some way (e.g., a box around the selection)
	- Answer is evaluated for correctness
		-- Response is provided to player via an animation 
			--- Correct response gets a green checkmark
			--- Incorrect answer gets a red X and the correct answer gets a green checkmark
	- Player earns 1 point for each correct answer. No points are lost for missed questions. 
	- Process repeats through 10 questions
	- Correct responses/ points are tracked throughout the game
	- At the end, the total points are provided to the player.
		-- A win entails, answering more than half the question correct, so 6 or more.
		-- On the final screen, a button is included asking if the player wants to play again. This restarts the game. 

//DO I WANT A THEME FOR QUESTIONS? FOCUS ON SOMETHING I KNOW.  

Stretch Goal:
	- Include a timer for answering each question, i.e, the player has 10 seconds to answer the question or it is marked incorrect
	- Add a second player.
	- Include a tracker for correct responses the player can see as he/she plays
	- Curate triva questions. Decide whether to expand to broader space theme, or stick to planets. Organize questions into into easy, intermediate and hard questions for first, second and third sections of game. 

Nice to haves (added after initial proposal):
	- Fonts
	- Styling/fonts for question pages


PROJECT PLAN / ACTION STEPS

	- Identify several trivia questions (~3) I can use for early phases of design and testing
	- Create homepage with invitation to play and yes/no buttons, with functionality for playing or exiting
		-- Use event listner ('onclick') to say "goodbye" for "no" and clear the screen for "yes"
	- Create first question page where trivia question is chosen at random, with functionality for player to click on a response
		-- If yes, clear homepage 
		-- Create div for question and child divs for choices
		--create an array of objects of questions and choices 
	- Create animation for player selection/response 
		-- Event listener (onclick) that puts box around selected answer
	- Compare input to correct answer
		-- If player selected answer with a ^ then "correct", else "incorrect"
	- Create animation for correct answer - green check mark by answer
		(Look back at lessons for day with pyramid lab)
	- Create tracking of correct answers
	- Create animation for incorrect answer - red x by incorrect selection (keeping initial outline around selection, and green checkmark by correct answer)
	- Initiate moving to next question, excluding question already displayed
	- Create loop to move through 3 questions and the steps repeat 
	- Create assessment page, if player got >=2 question right = win, if player got <=1 questions right, show counter on screen, invite to play again with yes/no button
	- Add bank of trivia questions (~25). Decide on theme. 
	- Update code (if necessary) to accomodate additional trivia questions


QUESTIONS:
	- What file type do I store my question bank and how do I format it so they can be selected for the game?
	- Why aren't my yes/no button centering? (they did when I had body set to text-align: center;)
	- How do I style #noBtn message? Currently it appends immediately after button and I'd like for it to start on a new line, be larger, centered, etc.
